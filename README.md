## Project Overview

The Single-Cycle Processor project aims to develop a processor featuring a single-cycle execution model. In this architecture, each instruction is executed within a single clock cycle, which simplifies the control logic and improves overall performance. By implementing this architecture, the processor can achieve faster execution times compared to more complex architectures like pipelined or multi-cycle processors.

## Features

- Single-cycle execution: Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle.
- Simplified control logic: The control logic is simplified due to the single-cycle architecture.
- Improved performance: The single-cycle architecture allows for faster execution times.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Use ModelSim to compile & simulate code

## Project Overview

The Pipelined Processor with Memory Delay and Cache project aims to construct a processor that integrates a pipelined architecture to improve throughput and execution speed. The pipeline is divided into multiple stages, allowing multiple instructions to be executed concurrently. Additionally, a memory delay of 3 clocks is incorporated to handle memory accesses. To further enhance performance, a cache is implemented to reduce memory access latency.

## Features

- Pipelined architecture: The processor consists of multiple stages for concurrent instruction execution.
- Memory delay: A memory delay of 3 clocks is introduced to handle memory accesses.
- Cache implementation: A cache is integrated to reduce memory access latency and improve overall performance.
