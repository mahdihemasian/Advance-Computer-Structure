## Project Overview

The Single-Cycle Processor project aims to develop a processor featuring a single-cycle execution model. In this architecture, each instruction is executed within a single clock cycle, which simplifies the control logic and improves overall performance. By implementing this architecture, the processor can achieve faster execution times compared to more complex architectures like pipelined or multi-cycle processors.

## Features

- Single-cycle execution: Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle.
- Simplified control logic: The control logic is simplified due to the single-cycle architecture.
- Improved performance: The single-cycle architecture allows for faster execution times.
